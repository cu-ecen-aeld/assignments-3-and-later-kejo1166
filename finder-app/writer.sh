# Summary
# - Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, 
# referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred 
# to below as writestr
# - Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
# - Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating 
# the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
